# Disrupt: A Manifesto

We are disrupt, an open and decentralized movement that aims to be a force in critically working against opressive power systems.
A network for ideas, tools and collective action to systematically challenge conventional ideas about how society can be run.


## Our motivations

- Trends ✈️ Change
  - Real issues have been commodified into trends. Our society needs real change, not trends.
- Challenging the passive "woke" culture
  - Too many people are complacent in their existence within society (brought on by a myriad of factors). We need more DIY and less inaction.

## Key Values

- Sharing of tools, techniques, skills and knowledge.
  - Tactics for demonstration. Such as Boycotting, Subvertism, Brandalism and piggybacking viral culture for mass dissemination.
  - Workshops for sharing and practicing all of the above.

- Engaging and uplifiting marginalised voices through community based projects.
  - Community projects led by the Community

- Critically engaging with both online and offline technologies of power.
  - Resisting surveillance capatalism through active disruption of "the algorithm".
  - Neoliberism is parasitic in its creation of capital at all costs. We seek to educate and provide genuine solutions to disengage and resist its most pervasive incarnation psychopolitics.
